## Project 1: Prompt injection and private data linkage security using LLM
* The program provides an AI based chat interface to create letters and movie title  
* Design solution to prompt injection
* Design solution to user private data linkage 
* Using OpenAI LLM shelf model in the chat interface, as well in the defensing mechanism

## Project 2: Ml implementations 
### RNF python implementation
* data set: "Heart attacks"
* Used Packages: sklearn, panda, numpy
* Rows number: 303
* Type: classification 
* Results: 80-85 (f1 score)
* Description: Implemented the Random forest model. 
  Each tree is implemented by Sklearn Tree Packages.
  The bootstrap tool is used by default to randomize the data.
  A result comparison is made in the main script between my this implementation and sklearn RNF implementation.
  
### logistic regression implementation
* data set: "Is weight more then 50?"
* Using age and height can it be predicted if a person weights more then 50
* Used Packages: sklearn, panda, numpy
* Rows number: 1000
* Type: classification 
* Results: 0.95 (Accuracy)
* Description:  Implemented logistic regression using the Newton-Raphson
method to estimate model coefficients. The function employs the log
link function and uses the odds ratio as input. The model's results 
have been compared to the Sklearn implementation, yielding similar outcomes.
* Side-note: the Probit, Log-Log and Cauchit link functions are yet to be implemented

## Project 3: Create API program using Docker, Kubernetes and restAPI
* Used Packages: BinaryTree, fastapi, starlette, uvicorn, typing, pickle, os
* Description: Look for more description inside the project itself
