## Project 2: RNF python implementation
* data set: "Heart attacks"
* Used Packages: sklearn, panda, numpy
* Rows number: 303
* Type: classification 
* Results: 80-85 (f1 score)
* Description: In this project I have implemented the Random forest model. 
  In this version, each tree in the forest is created from the sklearn.tree Packages.
  The default state is using bootstrap to rnadomize the data.
  I added a result comparison in the main between my RND implementation and sklearn RNF implementation.
