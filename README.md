## Project 1: Prompt injection and private data linkage security using LLM
* The program provides an AI based chat interface to create letters and movie title  
* Design solution to prompt injection
* Design solution to user private data linkage 
* Using OpenAI LLM shelf model in the chat interface, as well in the defensing mechanism

## Project 2: Create API program using Docker, Kubernetes and restAPI
* Used Packages: BinaryTree, fastapi, starlette, uvicorn, typing, pickle, os
* Description: Look for more description inside the project itself

## Project 3: RNF python implementation
* data set: "Heart attacks"
* Used Packages: sklearn, panda, numpy
* Rows number: 303
* Type: classification 
* Results: 80-85 (f1 score)
* Description: Implemented the Random forest model. 
  Each tree is implemented by Sklearn Tree Packages.
  The bootstrap tool is used by default to randomize the data.
  A result comparison is made in the main script between my this implementation and sklearn RNF implementation.
